<p class="coding"> Openness may not completely disarm prejudice, but it's a good place to start.-Jason Collins </p>
<div class="main">
<p>what is Transgender Equality?</p>
<p>Transgender inequality is the unequal protection transgender people receive in work, school, and society in general. </P>
<p>Transgender people regularly face transphobic harassment. Ultimately, one of the largest reasons that transgender people face inequality is due to a lack of public understanding of transgender people</P>
<p> eventhough the society in our country is peace and understanding but its still unaware of how they should be treating transgenderpeople.</P>

<p> as we all have heard that "prevention is better than cure"we should solve and normalize it before our upcoming generation thinks it as abnormal gender</p>
<p> eventhough our country legally accepts LGBTQ people, they still dont come out since they fear that they might have to face harassment and exploitation</p>
<p> so that these dont feel this,we should conduct more campaigns and organization inorder to help raise their voice and help them come out proudly!</p>
