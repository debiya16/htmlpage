    <p>The reason why I chose this social issue is because I wanted to  inform everyone how it is important to understand this issue and support it.</p>
    <p> The world seems to be accepting it but its still a secret in our country even though its ones legal right to  be what ever they want.</p>
    <p>I have seen many people being shamed or outcast just because they are different. so I want to help change it.</P>
